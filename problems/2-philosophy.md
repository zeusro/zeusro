## The ultimate question of philosophy

- Q

```
Where are you from？
Who are you？
Where are you going?
```

- A

    I do not know who I am, so I must embark on a journey to find my true self. When I finally discover who I am, the path I took will become the answer to that question — and by then, I will also know where I am going.
